![Rosetta Stone](http://www.steenvanrosette.nl/images/rosette.gif)

The Rosetta Stone is one of the most incredible artifacts ever found--without it, much of human history would be illegible. By recording the exact same text in three different languages, the Rosetta Stone allowed someone who spoke any one language to easily deciper and learn any of the others.

An oft-repeated mantra of software is that once you learn your first programming language, it's really easy to learn another. It generally holds true because the concepts, fundamentals, and even syntax of most languages are fairly similar to one another. 

Still, I have not seen any resources dedicated to helping programmers easily and learn their second or third languages after they've already crossed the hurdle of learning their first one. So I hope Rosetta, like the eponymous Rosetta Stone, will show how to perform the same basic tasks in a variety of languages. 

I will try to stick to the idiomatic forms and best-practices for each language and so I hope this will be useful to beginners and experts alike.
